##About the project:##
I have been working with Arduino as a hobby for a few years now and wanted to something different and build something that starts to take the hardware and code to its very edge. 

I wish to take various data end points and display them to a browser available in all devices.  As well as control and drive the packages on the vehicle itself. In some ways changing the display.

To sweep in a defined arc in front of the rover with a ultra sonic range sensor.  The data is kept in the control board until a sweep is complete, transmitted externally to other systems. Given options such as minimum range sending control messages to the motor control system and set control flags.  The flags will set a stop message and if the stop condition clears also transmit a clear message.
