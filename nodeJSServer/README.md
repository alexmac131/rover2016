#I2C Rover Multi Board Controls

by Alex Mackinnon
 
##About the project:##
I have been working with Arduino as a hobby for a few years now and wanted to something different and build something that starts to take the hardware and code to its very edge. 

This is basically version 3 with new physical hardware, new code and the introduction of I2C and multi-unit control boards. Intentionally mixing different classes of Arduino boards, raspberry pi 1 & 2, particle IO boards and others.

##License:##

The majority of this software is licensed in exchange for two liters
of India Pale Ale, to be delivered at a neighborly bar.
